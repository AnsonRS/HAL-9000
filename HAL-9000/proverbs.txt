Into every life a little rain must fall
It goes without saying
It is all grist to the mill
It is an ill wind that blows no one any good
It is best to be on the safe side
It is better to give than to receive
It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It is better to cultivate a Land with two Bulls, rather working under Boss who never gives Wage when asked
It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It is easy to be wise after the event
It is never too late
It is no use crying over spilt milk
It is no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted

It takes a thief to catch a thief
It needs a Hundred Lies to cover a Single Lie
It takes all sorts to make a world
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango
I'm going to have to give you the pink slip

No guts, no glory
No man can serve two masters
No man is an island
No names, no pack-drill

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing succeeds like success,
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

The squeaking wheel gets the grease
The straw that broke the camel's back
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
There ain't no such thing as a free lunch
There are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream
There are none so blind as those that will not see
There are two sides to every question
There but for the grace of God go I
There is an exception to every rule
There are always more fish in the sea
There is honour among thieves
There is many a good tune played on an old fiddle
There is many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
There is more than one way to skin a cat
There is no accounting for tastes
There is no fool like an old fool
There is no place like home
There is no smoke without fire
There is no such thing as a free lunch
There is no such thing as bad publicity
There is no time like the present
There is none so blind as those who will not see
There's none so deaf as those who will not hear
There is nowt so queer as folk
There is one born every minute
There is safety in numbers
They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind
Third time is a charm
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas
Time and tide wait for no man
Time flies
Time is a great healer
Time is money
Time will tell
’Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
To be worn out is to be renewed.
To each his own.
To err is human, to forgive divine
To the victor go the spoils
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow never comes
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth will out
Two blacks do not make a white
Two heads are better than one
Two is company, but three is a crowd
Two wrongs do not make a right
Variety is the spice of life.
Walk softly but carry a big stick.
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
Waste not, want not
What cannot be cured must be endured
What goes around, comes around
What goes up must come down
What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts
What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
When it rains it pours.
When the cat is away, the mice will play
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the oak is before the ash, then you will only get a splash; when the ash is before the oak, then you may expect a soak
When three women gather, it becomes noisy.
What the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over
Where there is a will there is a way
Where there is muck there is brass
Whether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right.
While there is life there is hope
Whom the Gods love die young
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
With a responsibility comes great power
Woman is the root of both good and evil
Wonders will never cease
Work expands so as to fill the time available
Worrying never did anyone any good
You ain't seen nothing yet
You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can have too much of a good thing
You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink
You cannot have your cake and eat it too
You cannot get blood out of a stone
You cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear
You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs
You cannot make bricks without straw
You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
You cannot judge a book by its cover
You cannot win them all
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You pay your money and you take your choice
Youth is wasted on the young
You must have rocks in your head
