# HAL-9000
##About:
This started as some friends having fun in Discord. When we realized we could customize peoples bots to our liking we ran with it. One night we made it say "I'm sorry @person I'm afraid I can't do that." and it just went from there. Here we are later with an organized system and working on creating a bot that has the same functionalities but is even better than before.
###**Note:** _The bot is currently being worked on. Nothing is final as of now._
###Please see the wiki for instructions.
