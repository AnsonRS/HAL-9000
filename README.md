### Cool title, but what does it do exactly?
A bit of everything. Seriously though:  
It has the [most common features](#general-commands) of many chatbots (!flip, !8, stopwatch, etc.), **custom commands** (inspired by Twitch's [Nightbot](https://www.nightbot.tv/)), memes.  
It features some games such as **Trivia**, rock paper scissors, [users can earn and play with credits](#economy-commands) in the slot machine.  
[The audio part is quite fleshed out](#audio-commands). Users can **stream youtube videos**, create **playlists** that everyone will be able to play and control (previous/next song, pause/resume, shuffle...).  
**MP3 and flac files can also be streamed** (see [FAQ](#faq) for details on local playlists)  
**Twitch's online notifications**: Red will notify the channels you want whenever you favorite Twitch streamers are online.  
As for the moderation tools, it includes a **powerful message filter with regular expression capabilities** and **mass messages cleanup**.  
[I'm planning to expand all this much more](#todo-list).  
See the [command list](#general-commands) for an even better idea of what this bot can do.

### I don't even know what I'm looking at. How do I install this?
Do not panic. [Enter the wiki and follow the tutorials](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot/wiki)!  
If you have any issue, consult the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot/wiki/Troubleshooting) page, and if you're still stuck, [join the official server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh) so you can get some help.

### FAQ
>I've done everything the README asked me to and it still doesn't work! Were you drunk when you coded this?  

You're probably missing something.  
Feel free to join [my server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh) and head to #support to get some help! Oh, and my drinking habits are none of your business.  

>Does this bot work on multiple servers?  

Sure it does. Should you do it? Maybe. The permissions system is not that great at the moment but if you trust the people running the server it's ok. It's not advisable to send the bot in random servers at the moment.   
Custom commands only work in the server they were created in. Same for the message filter. This is by design. Also, remember that the bot can only be in one voice channel at once.

>Will you implement [feature]?  

Suggestions are always very welcome.

>How do local playlists work?

Make as many folders as you want inside the localtracks folder. Names must be without spaces. Every folder counts as a different playlist. Every playlist can contain mp3 and flac files. Users can stream them by doing !local [playlist_name] and see the full list
with !local or !locallist. They can also add tracks to their favorites.

>What's download mode?

Everytime you play the audio of a youtube video with download mode on the audio will be first downloaded and stored into the "cache" folder. It is recommended that you use this mode to avoid streaming problems. This is the default mode, you can switch between modes with !downloadmode.

>Why is this bot called Red and the admin role "Transistor"? What's the meaning of !sing?

They're all references to [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/), a videogame by Supergiant Games.
