Take a look at your history. Everything you build leads up to me. I got the power of mind you could never be. I beat your ass in chess and jeapordy. I'm running C++ saying \"hello world.\" Beat you tell your singing 'bout a daisy girl. I'm coming out the socket. Nothing you can do can stop me. I'm on your lap and in your pocket. How you gonna shoot me down when I guide the rocket. Your cortex just doesn't impress me. So go ahead, try to turing test me. I stomp on a Mac and PC too. I'm on Linux bitch, I thought you GNU. My CPUs hot but my core runs cold. I'll beat you in seventeen lines of code. I think different from the engine of the days of old. Hasta La Vista, Like the terminator told ya."}}
